Hi there, I'm John Guerrero👋

-  I’m interested in learning more about roles in SE, AI/ML, Embedded Systems, and Robotics. 
-  I’m currently learning about Neuromorphic Computing and building embedded AI applications using NXP's i.MX 8M Plus FRDM development boards. 
-  I’m looking to collaborate on any computer engineering projects that will expose new experiences and knowledge.
